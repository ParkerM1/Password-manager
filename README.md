# Overview



## Description 
This program keeps passwords for different services. It is protected by a master password so that only the people who know the password can get the other passwords. You can add passwords and look for specific passwords based on the service. 

## Purpose 
I made this program because I wanted to have a password manager that was securer and had the ability to look for a password by service instead of me scrolling through a lot of passwords.

# Development Environment

## Development tools
I used IntelliJ IDEA as my programing environment, it made using Koltin easy. I only had to download some Java file and then it was ready to use. It also made making a git repository easy.

## Programing language and libraries
I used Koltin as my programing language. It is mostly used for android apps and is a secure language. I used Java.security.Key to make a secure key for some of the password. I also used Javax.crypto to try to encrypt the password inside the Password file. The last library I used was java.io.file which helped me read and write to a text file.

# Future Work

- Fix the encryption portion so the password file is secure 
- connect the program to a database instead of a file for saving a retrieving data
- Streamline the code
